<P> A system for processing materials includes handling and cutting stations
     positioned at appropriate positions along first and second conveying
     portions. A crust cutting station is positioned along the first conveyor
     portion. A crust removal station is positioned to span across the first
     and second conveying portions. Similarly, a stacking station is also
     positioned to span across the first and second conveying portions.
     Further, a first (vertical) cross cutting station is position along the
     second conveyor portion. Similarly, a second (horizontal) cross cutting
     station is located along the second conveyor portion. The process of
     using the disclosed system eliminates the need for specially designed
     stacking frames or trays and support <B><I>rods,</I></B> and improves cutting capacity
     and reduces processing time by only stacking the materials to be
     processed once, without de-stacking and restacking steps.

<BR><BR> The present invention relates generally to the field of manufacturing and processing materials, and more particularly to a system and method of cutting and handling materials which may be used as products for building or construction.  Exemplary
materials for processing may include porous (foamed) or cellular lightweight concrete blocks or slabs.  The exemplary system and method of cutting and handling materials is particularly suited for processing Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) blocks and
slabs in a semi-plastic state (also known as green cake).
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) blocks and slabs are produced in many different ways.  The numerous methods of producing AAC blocks and slabs share the same general process, with differences between methods arising in the manner of handling
and cutting the green cake.  In each of the existing processes the output capacity of the manufacturing plant is greatly influenced by the capacity of the cutting machines.
<BR><BR> The general process of producing AAC blocks and slabs may include the following steps.  To begin, the cementous raw material, combined with a rising agent such as aluminum powder and water, is thoroughly mixed and poured into an open top mold.
<BR><BR> After a sufficient period of time in which rising has occurred and the mix is sufficiently stable enough to handle (in the semi-plastic, or green cake, state), the sides of the mold are opened and the green cake is picked up by a grab crane and
placed on a cutting machine on a specially designed frame positioned over cross cutting wires.
<BR><BR> The green cake is next cross cut by oscillating cross cutting wires.  Then the cake is pushed through vertical and horizontal sets of oscillating cutting wires to complete cutting the cake in three directions.  The specially designed frame
passes under the machine and picks up the cake at the other end, which is a very complicated and costly design.
<BR><BR> The specially designed frame with the cut cake thereon next moves to a vacuum crane which lifts the uneven top and side crusts of the cake and releases them onto a recycling bin adjacent to the cake.
<BR><BR> The frame is then moved to a stacking station where several frames (usually three) are stacked one over the other by a stacking crane, with manually placed <B><I>steel</I></B> columns, which act as spacer <B><I>rods,</I></B> positioned in between the stacked cakes and
frames.
<BR><BR> The set of stacked frames and cakes is then placed in an autoclave for steam curing at elevated temperature and pressure.
<BR><BR> After curing and removal from the autoclave, the stacked frames and cakes are then de-stacked by a de-stacking crane with manual removal of the <B><I>steel</I></B> columns.  After de-stacking, the finished product is then stacked again for palletizing.
<BR><BR> Thus, as can be seen from the above discussion, existing methods of processing AAC blocks and slabs require substantial equipment, time, and manual labor.  In particular, the above described process requires the use of specially designed frames
and spacer <B><I>rods</I></B> to support and stack the green cake.
<BR><BR> Further, the above described process requires the cut green cake and frames to be initially stacked for placement in the autoclave, de-stacked once removed from the autoclave, and subsequently restacked for palletizing and delivery.
<BR><BR> Thus, there is a need for a less complex, and time and labor saving system and method for processing material that avoids the disadvantages of the type of system and method described above.  The exemplary system and method of processing
materials described herein provides such a less complex, and time and labor saving system and method for processing material by increasing the capacity of a cutting machine, reducing or eliminating manual labor, eliminating stacking, de-stacking, and
re-stacking steps, and eliminating the need for several major components used in the process described above.  Thus, the exemplary described system and method reduce equipment and operational costs, and therefore also reduce the cost of the product.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> A system and method for processing material is disclosed.  The system eliminates the need of specially designed trays or frames and spacers.  Additionally, the system eliminates several steps such as stacking, de-stacking and re-stacking.  The
system farther reduces or eliminates manual labor associated with placing the spacer <B><I>rods</I></B> and removing them between frames associated with an eliminated stacking step.
<BR><BR> The system and method generally begins at the stage where green cake in the open top mold is ready for processing.  At least first and second green cakes are utilized to begin the process.  It is recognized that more than two green cakes may be
utilized.  The first green cake is passed through a crust cutting station and the cut crust of the first green cake is removed.  It will be recognized that when more than two green cakes are utilized, the crusts will be removed from intermediately
stacked green cakes as well.
<BR><BR> Next, the first green cake is placed directly on the first cross cutting station and the second green cake is stacked on top of the first green cake.  Both stacked cakes are then simultaneously cut in two directions (vertically).
<BR><BR> The stacked green cakes are next moved to the second cross cutting station to be cut in the third direction (horizontally), which also cuts the crust of the second (top) green cake.  The crust of the second green cake is then removed, and the
stacked first and second green cakes are transferred to the autoclave for final curing.  The stacked first and second green cakes do not need to be stacked for placement in the autoclave and do not need to be de-stacked after leaving the autoclave, and
subsequently need not be re-stacked for palletizing.
<BR><BR> The advantages of the above described system and method are numerous.  For example, the introduction of two directional cross cutting stations eliminates the need of costly frames, and complicated cutting machines.
<BR><BR> Further, the concept of directly stacking cakes without frames in between and cutting them vertically in one pass substantially increases cutting capacity.  This further eliminates the need of several subsequent machines and equipment
components, such as a stacking machine, a de-stacking machine, and special frames and support <B><I>rods</I></B>.  Direct stacking of the green cakes also simplifies palletizing by eliminating the need of restacking of the finished products.
<BR><BR> As described above, the cutting process is separated into two distinct cutting stations.  The first station is for the two directional vertical cutting and the second station is for the horizontal cutting.  The benefit of this separation is to
free the first station after completing the vertical cutting to restart the next vertical cutting cycle while the other cakes are being cut horizontally at the second station.  In other words after the initial stacked cakes are cut vertically and moved
to the horizontal cutting station, vertical and horizontal cutting is done simultaneously on two sets of stacked cakes to increase cutting capacity of the system.
<BR><BR> The numerous advantages, features and functions of the exemplary embodiment of a system and method for processing material will further become readily apparent and better understood in view of the following description and accompanying drawings. The following description is not intended to limit the scope of the system and method for processing material, but instead merely provides exemplary embodiments for ease of understanding. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>A. Environment and Context of the Exemplary Embodiment
<BR><BR> Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) as well as similar types of porous light weight concrete (foam concrete), is produced in a well known and traditional manner and cured to a semi-plastic state (green cake) in an open top or other suitable mold. 
The exemplary embodiment disclosed herein describes a system and method for processing material, in particular of handling and cutting the green cake (semi-plastic state) in a simple and efficient way to increase the capacity of the cutting machine while
eliminating numerous steps, machines and components, and manual labor necessary for many conventionally cutting and handling systems and methods.
<BR><BR> While the following discussion describes a system and method used to process two green cakes, it will be recognized that the principles discussed herein with respect to two green cakes may be extended to process more than two green cakes.
<BR><BR>B Detailed Description of an Exemplary Embodiment
<BR><BR> An exemplary embodiment of a system 10 for processing material is shown generally in FIG. 1.  The system may be used to process lightweight concrete materials, such as, for example, Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) blocks and slabs, porous
(foamed) or cellular lightweight concrete blocks or slabs, or any other semi-plastic or plastic materials suitable for processing into blocks or slabs.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 1, the exemplary material processing system includes first and second parallel conveyor and track portions 12, 14.  While the illustrated track portions 12, 14 are each composed of two parallel tracks, it will be recognized that
any suitable conveying system may be utilized.  For example, conveyer belts, rollers, or other appropriate conveying mechanisms may be substituted for the shown track systems 12, 14.
<BR><BR> As will be discussed in more detail below, handling and cutting stations are positioned at appropriate positions along the track portions 12, 14.  In particular, a crust cutting station 28 is positioned along the first conveyor portion 12. 
Additionally, a crust removal station 38 is positioned to span across the first and second conveying portions 12, 14.  Similarly, a stacking station 64 is also positioned to span across the first and second conveying portions 12, 14.  Further, a first
(vertical) cross cutting station 84 is position along the second conveyor portion 14.  Similarly, a second (horizontal) cross cutting station 94 is located along the second conveyor portion 14.
<BR><BR> As further shown in FIG. 1, conveying platforms or carts 16 having a substantially planar supporting surface are utilized to support and transport semi-plastic block materials (green cakes, or simply cakes) along each of the first and second
conveying portions 12, 14.  If as shown, the first and second conveying portions 12, 14 are composed of tracks, then each of the conveying platforms or carts 16 will include wheels or rollers 18 for cooperating with the track portions 12, 14 to transport
the cakes thereon.  If a roller or conveyer belt system is utilized, the conveying platforms need not include wheels or rollers, but may simply be planar supporting surfaces.
<BR><BR> Prior to utilizing the system 10 to process and cut cakes, at least first and second cakes 24, 26 are semi-cured into a semi-plastic state via the use of open top molds 20, or any suitable type of mold.  The open top molds 20 include openable
mold sides 22, which may be hinged to the base of the mold or completely removable therefrom.  As previously mentioned, the system may be utilized to process and stack more than two cakes, as long as the lower cake strength will support the weight of the
upper cakes.  Additionally, the system is designed for continuous operation such that each station is actively processing cakes in a continuous manner that will be further described below.
<BR><BR> Once the cakes 24, 26 have sufficiently hardened in the molds 20 so that the cakes 24, 26 can be handled and stacked the cakes 24, 26 within the molds 20 can be positioned in a continuous, end to end manner on the first conveying portion 12 to
begin processing.  It will be noted that the use of the open top molds produces an uneven surface on the top of each of the cakes 24, 26, which it is necessary to remove for stacking purposes, and also for cosmetic reasons.
<BR><BR> Prior to beginning the processing of the cakes 24, 26, the sides 22 of the molds 20 are opened to allow access to the sides of the cakes 24, 26.  Once the molds 20 are opened, the first cake 24 is transported along the first conveyor portion 12
towards the crust cutting station 28.
<BR><BR> The crust cutting station includes two opposed vertical stays 30 positioned on either side of the first conveyor portion 12 and connected along a top portion thereof by a horizontal stay 32.  An adjustable height horizontal cutting wire 34 also
spans between the opposed vertical stays 30.  The cutting wire is connected to <B><I>rods</I></B> along the stays 30 via clamps.  The clamps can be loosened and tightened to allow the clamps to be vertically moved along the <B><I>rods</I></B> for the height adjustment. 
Alternatively, the <B><I>rods</I></B> themselves may be vertically moved to adjust the height of the cutting wire 34.  The <B><I>rods</I></B> are used to oscillate the cutting wire 34 in a known manner.
<BR><BR> Once the first cake 24 has filly passed through the crust cutting station 28, the height of the cutting wire 34 is increased to allow the second cake 26 to pass therethrough without cutting the crust thereof.  In this manner, one cutting step is
eliminated from the process.  Once the second cake 26 has fully passed through the crust cutting station 28, the height of the cutting wire 34 is decreased in preparation of the next first cake to be passed therethrough.  The height adjustment of the
cutting wire 34 also allows a user to adjust the amount of crust to be removed from the cakes to account for any irregularities between cakes or materials.
<BR><BR> Once the first cake 24 passes through the crust cutting station 28, an uneven removable crust 36 remains on top of the first cake 24.  The first cake 24 will then be transported to the crust removal station 38, where the uneven crust 36 is
removed from the first cake 24.
<BR><BR> As seen in FIGS. 1 and 4, the crust removal station 38 includes a double headed vacuum hood 40 that is used to remove uneven crusts from the first cakes 24, and in a manner to be discussed below, from the second cakes 26.  The double headed
vacuum hood 40 is mounted to a horizontal stay 44 that spans between two vertical stays 42 that are positioned in an opposed manner between the first and second conveyor portions 12, 14.  A vacuum generator 46 is positioned on the horizontal stay 44 and
is connected to first and second hoods 50, 52 via flexible vacuum hosing 48.
<BR><BR> Each of the vacuum hoods 50, 52 is mounted to respective vertical supports 54, which in turn are pivotally mounted to two sets of horizontal pivoting arms 56.  The horizontal pivoting arms 56 are themselves mounted to the vertical stays 42 at
pivot points 58.  A lowering and lifting mechanism 60, such as hydraulic or pneumatic piston and cylinders or electric motors are provided to alternately raise and lower the first and second hoods 50, 52 via the pivot arms 56, in a manner that will be
recognized to a skilled artisan.
<BR><BR> Once the first cake 24 with the cut crust 36 is positioned below the first hood 50, the first hood 50 is lowered so that the crust 36 may be removed from the first cake 24 via the suction created by the vacuum within the hood 50.  When the crust
36 is engaged with the hood 50 via the negative pressure, the hood 50 is raised and the first cake 24 is transported along the first conveyor portion 12 to a standby position.
<BR><BR> When the first cake 24 has cleared the crust removal station 38, the vacuum within the first hood 50 is released, so that the crust 36 will disengage therefrom.  A single or two recycling bins or tanks 62 are positioned below the first and
second conveyor portions 12, 14 to receive the removed crust 36, which is dropped into the tank 62 when the vacuum within the hood 50 is released.
<BR><BR> Once the crust 36 has been removed from the first cake 24, a relatively smooth and substantially planar surface remains on the top of the first cake 24 to provide a suitable supporting surface for the stacking thereon of a second cake 26, as
will be further described below.
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the first cake is transported to the stacking station 64 following the crust removal from the first cake 24.  The stacking station 64 spans across both the first and second conveyor portions 12, 14, and is
utilized to transfer the first and second cakes 24, 26 from the first conveying portion 12 to the second conveying portion 14.
<BR><BR> The stacking station 64 includes vertical stays 66 positioned on either side of, and between the first and second conveyor portions 12, 14.  Horizontal stays 68 span between the vertical stays 66 to provide support for a grab crane 70.  The grab
crane 70 is supported on wheels or rollers 74 along translation tracks 72 that are positioned on top of one set of horizontal stays 68.
<BR><BR> The grab crane 70 includes a grabbing and release mechanism 76, as well as lifting and translating mechanisms 78, which all may be driven in a known manner by hydraulics, pneumatics, and/or electric motors.  A standard grab crane 70, as will be
recognized by a skilled artisan, may be utilized, and further discussion of the specifics the grab crane 70 are not provided.
<BR><BR> Once the first cake 24 reaches the stacking station 64, the grab crane 70 is lowered and clamped around the cake 24 to lift the cake 24 from the conveying platform 16 on the first conveyor portion 12.  Once the first cake 24 has been lifted by
the grab crane 70, the grab crane 70 translates across to the second conveyor portion 14.
<BR><BR> A first (vertical) cross cutting station 84 is positioned at the second conveying portion 14 directly across from the first conveying portion 12, and within the stacking station 64.  A conveying platform 16 is located and locked from moving at
the first cutting station 84 to receive the first cake 24 thereon.  The conveying platform 16 is a suitable platform for use with an autoclave (such as an autoclave cart), so that the cut green cakes do not need to be removed from the conveying platform
16 in order to be processed within the autoclave (not illustrated).
<BR><BR> The first cutting station 84 includes a cutting frame 86 that is mounted to the vertical stays 66 in a known manner to be vertically raised from a lower (first) position to an upper (second) position, and lowered from the upper position to the
lower position.  Two sets of oscillating cutting wires 90 span between each edge of the cutting frame 86 in a substantially orthogonal manner.  The cutting wires 90 are oscillated in a known manner.  Further, the cutting wires 90 can be adjustable, as
previously discussed, in order to adjust the cutting width therebetween or to accommodate different sized cakes.
<BR><BR> Prior to the transfer of the first cake 24 from the first conveyor portion 12 to the first cutting station 84, the cutting frame 86 is positioned around the conveyor platform 16 such that the cutting wires 90 rest upon the conveyor platform 16
or are positioned directly adjacent to the conveyor platform 16.  In this manner, when the first cake 24 is transferred to the cutting station 86 and released from the grab crane 70, the cake 24 is placed directly on top of the cutting wires 90.  There
is no need for specially designed frames or trays to support the cake 24 for cutting.
<BR><BR> Once the first cake 24 has been transferred to the first cutting station 84, and the stacking station 64 is empty at the first conveyor portion 12, the second cake 26 is moved along the first conveyor portion 12 to the stacking station.  The
grab crane 70 also translates back to the first conveyor portion 12 from the first cutting station 84 on the second conveyor portion 14.
<BR><BR> While the second cake 26 is being transported to the stacking station 64 and the grab crane 70 is translated to the first conveyor portion 12, the cutting frame 86, and hence the cutting wires 90, are vertically raised.  Lifting the cutting
frame 86 and the cutting wires 90 begins the process of creating vertical cuts 92 in the first cake 24.  While the first cake 24 is being vertically cut, the second cake 26 is lifted by the grab crane 70, translated from the first conveyor portion 12 to
the second conveyor portion 14, and lowered directly on top of the first cake 24 without the need for any special tray, frame, or supporting <B><I>rods</I></B> to be positioned between them.
<BR><BR> With the stacked cakes 80 positioned in the first cutting station 84, the cutting frame 86 continues to rise in one pass to create continuous vertical cuts 92 in the stacked cakes 80.  While the stacked cakes 80 are being cut vertically, the
grab crane 70 translates back to the first conveyor portion 12, and an additional first cake 24 is transferred to the stacking station 64 so that the process may be repeated in a continuous manner.  In alternate configurations, where more than two cakes
are stacked and processed, the additional cakes, instead of another first cake, will be transported to the stacking station 64, lifted and translated and added to the top of the stack 80 of cakes for cutting.
<BR><BR> Once the cutting frame 86 and the cutting wires 90 have passed completely through the stacked cakes 80, the cutting frame is momentarily maintained in the uppermost position while the vertically cut stacked cakes 80 are rapidly transferred to
the second (horizontal) cutting station 94.  Once the stacked cakes 80 have been transferred to the second cutting station 94, the cutting frame 86 is lowered around a conveying platform 16 that is moved into position in the first cutting station 84, and
the process of stacking a first cake 24 thereon begins again.  With this arrangement, since multiple stacks of cakes are being simultaneously processed, the capacity of the cutting machines is increased, and thus, the output of the system is increased.
<BR><BR> The second cutting station 94 is shown in FIGS. 1 and 3.  Similarly to other stations, the second cutting station 94 includes vertical stays 96 positioned on either side of the second conveyor portion 14 with horizontal stays 98 spanning
therebetween along the second conveyor portion 14.  Adjustable height oscillating cutting wires 100, of a type previously described, span across the second conveyor portion 14 between the downstream vertical stays 96, and are adjusted and oscillated as
previously described.  The adjustability of the cutting wires 100 allows different sized calves to be processed, as well as allowing for different sized final products.
<BR><BR> The second cutting station 94 includes a pusher/drive mechanism 102 that is utilized to advance the stacked cakes 80 through the second cutting station 94 to cause the cutting wires 100 to pass lengthwise through the stacked cakes 80.  The
pusher/drive mechanism 102 includes a drive frame 104 that is mounted for rack and pinion advancement along horizontally extending racks 106 that extend between the vertical stays 96 along the second conveyor portion 14.  A drive motor 108 is mounted to
the top of the drive frame 104 for driving pinions along the racks 106 in a recognized manner.  While a rack and pinion drive mechanism is described, any suitable drive mechanism may be used, for example a hydraulic or pneumatic piston drive mechanism,
or a cable drawn drive mechanism.
<BR><BR> The pusher/drive mechanism 102 further includes a pusher 118 that engages the stacked cakes 80 in a manner to be discussed below to advance the stacked cakes 80 through the second cutting station 94.  The pusher 118 includes a substantially
planar, vertically oriented pushing surface 120 to engage the stacked cakes 80.  In order to allow the stacked cakes 80 to pass into the second cutting station 94 from the first cutting station 84, the pusher 118 must be moved.
<BR><BR> A gate frame 110 attached to the drive frame 104 is provided to move the pusher 118 to allow the stacked cakes 80 to pass into the second cutting station 94 from the first cutting station 84.  The gate frame 110 has a lift motor 112 with a
pulley and one end of a lift cable 116 attached thereto.  It will be recognized that any suitable motor may be used, such as hydraulic or pneumatic pistons, or electric motors.
<BR><BR> The other end of the lift cable 116 is connected to the top of a lift gate 114, which has the pusher 118 mounted thereon.  The lift gate 114 is vertically lifted and lowered along the gate frame 110 via the lift cable 116 between a lower (first)
position and an upper (second) position.  In this manner, the pusher 118 is lifted above the stacked cakes 80 when they are transferred to the second cutting station 94 from the first cutting station 84.  Once the stacked cakes 80 have passed the lift
gate 114 and pusher 118, the lift gate 114 and pusher 118 are lowered into position upstream of the stacked cakes 80.
<BR><BR> When the lift gate 114 and pusher 118 are lowered into position, the drive mechanism 102 is engaged to cause the pushing surface 120 to contact the stacked cakes 80 in order to transport the stacked cakes 80 through the second cutting station 94
so that the horizontal cutting wires 100 can create horizontal cut lines 124 in the stacked cakes 80.  The uppermost cutting wire 100 also cuts the crust 126 from the second cake 26 for removal as will be discussed below.  A further horizontal
delineation 82 is created at the interface between the stacked first and second cakes 24, 26.
<BR><BR> Wire slots 122 are defined in the pushing surface 120 and along the width of the pusher 118 to receive the horizontal cutting wires 100 therein so that the cutting wires 100 can pass completely through the stacked cakes 80.
<BR><BR> As the stacked cakes 80 are transported through the second cutting station 94, the stacked cakes 80 make their way to the crust removal station 38.  At the crust removal station 38, the crust 126 of the second cake 26 is removed via a vacuum in
the second hood 52 in the same manner as previously discussed Once the stacked cakes 80 are further advanced past the crust removal station 38, the crust 126 of the second cake 26 is dropped into the recycling tank 62 via the release of the vacuum in the
second hood 52.
<BR><BR> Once the cut and stacked cakes 80 have passed beyond the crust removal station 38, they are further advanced to an autoclave (not shown) for final curing, for example by steam curing at elevated temperature and pressure.  After final curing the
final product blocks are already stacked and ready for simple palletizing without the need to be de-stacked and restacked to remove complex frames, trays, and support <B><I>rods</I></B>.
<BR><BR> As can be seen, once begun, the process can be continuously run to process multiple stacks of cakes simultaneously in order to increase the capacity of the system.  Further, the system does not require specially designed frames or trays and
support <B><I>rods</I></B> that would require de-stacking and re-stacking of the cakes multiple times during processing.
<BR><BR> A brief synopsis of the process is shown in FIG. 5, as analyzed from an upstream side (prior to the crust cutting station) towards a downstream side (after the crust removal station positioned at the second conveying portion).
<BR><BR> As a first step 128, at least first and second semi-plastic cakes 24, 26 are obtained in any suitable manner, such as from open top molds 20.  The cakes are next placed in the system 130 at the upstream side to begin processing.  If the cakes
are retained in molds, the molds are opened so that the cakes can be processed.
<BR><BR> The first cake 24 is advanced 132 to the crust cutting station 28, and the crust 36 is cut from the top of the first cake 24 to provide a substantially planar supporting surface for the second cake 26.
<BR><BR> The first cake is advanced 134 to the crust removal station 38, where the crust 36 is removed from the first cake 24.
<BR><BR> Both the first and second cakes 24, 26 are advanced 136 to the stacking station 64.  The first cake reaches the stacking station 64 first and is transferred 138 to the first cutting station 84.  Cutting of the first cake 24 begins and the second
cake 26 is transferred 140 from the stacking station 64 to the first cutting station 84 and placed directly on top of the first cake 24 for one pass cutting, without the need for specially designed stacking frames or trays and support <B><I>rods</I></B>.
<BR><BR> Next, the stacked cakes 80 are advanced 142 to the second cutting station for cutting the stacked cakes in one pass in a different direction.
<BR><BR> The stacked cakes 80 are next advanced to the second portion of the crust removal station 38, and the crust 126 of the second cake 26 is removed 144.
<BR><BR> The stacked cakes 80 are next advanced 146 directly to an autoclave for final curing, without the need to de-stack or restack the cakes.  Once the stacked cakes 80 are finally cured, the final product is removed 148 from the autoclave for direct
palletizing, without de-stacking or restacking, for transport and delivery to vendors, distributors, and/or job sites.
<BR><BR> Thus, as can be seen from the above described system and process, a less complex system that eliminates certain machines and components of conventional systems, reduces or eliminates manual labor, and improves cutting capacity and reduces
processing time by only stacking the cakes once, thus eliminating certain de-stacking and restacking steps, is therefore provided.
