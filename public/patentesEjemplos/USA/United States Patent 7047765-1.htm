<BR><BR> 2.  The ear attachment of claim 1 wherein the single entry of the female receptacle is perpendicular to said side that attaches to an earring.
<BR><BR> 3.  The ear attachment of claim 1 wherein the single entry of the female receptacle is parallel to said side that attaches to an earring.<HR> <CENTER><B><I> Description</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR><a name =”Background_Bookmark”>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
</a><BR><BR> At present time when jewelers create a pair of earrings, they have to make a usually non-reversible decision about the method by which the earrings are going to be attached to the ears.  The earrings are either made to be used on pierced ears or
made to be used with clips.  A common solution for this problem has been to create one or more pairs for pierced ears and one or more pairs to be clipped.  If the jeweler is good at estimating future demand, he/she will create the correct amount of
pierced and the correct amount of clipped to satisfy his/her customer demands.  But, as we all know, with this estimation it is very difficult to be precise, and even more so if the earrings are going to the market for the first time.  When the earrings
are expensive, the estimation becomes very important.  A jeweler having the right customer and the right earrings, but the wrong ear attachment becomes very frustrated when he/she loses business solely because of this factor.  The jeweler has to make the
earrings for one type of earring attachment and hope that he/she has made the right decision.
<BR><BR> To overcome these shortcomings of existing options, the present invention is developed to produce an effective means to facilitate the creation of earrings with the right type of ear attachment all the time.  The invention described here will
provide simple means of creating different kinds of earring attachments.
<BR><BR> The flexibility of our universal earring clip device will ensure that no matter what the customer needs as an earring attachment this need is met.  This is accomplished because the universal earring clip device easily conforms to the customer's
needs with a minimum of effort on the jeweler or person assembling the earrings for the final customer.
<BR><BR><a name =”Summary_Bookmark”>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
</a><BR><BR> The present invention is a device for facilitating the setting of the ear attachment method on earrings.  Examples of ear attachment methods are: a post (A pin-like finding attached to an earring.  It passes through the pierced earlobe, and may
be held in place by a back) depicted in FIG. 1 number 11, a clip-back (works like a hinge to secure the earring to the earlobe) depicted in FIG. 2, a European wire (A curved wire which passes through the earlobe of a pierced ear and clasps shut) depicted
in FIG. 3, and a hook ear wire (A fishhook-shaped finding with the hook end passing through the pierced ear) depicted in FIG. 4.  This is not an exhaustive list of clipping methods, but a list of the most common ones today.
<BR><BR> The device in this invention is comprised of a universal female clipping connector and a variety of male clipping connectors.  The universal female connector is attached to the back of the earring (depicted in FIG. 5 number 3 and in number 6
FIGS. 6 and 7), by means of soldering or gluing it to the earring.  This is the only process the manufacturer has to do with the earring.  The earring designer should be aware of the size and position of the universal female connector while designing
his/her earring.  The earring with the universal female attached to its back can now be shown to the customer depicted in FIG. 5 number 1.  Once the final user of the earring selects the ear attachment method that he/she is going to want on the earrings,
the jeweler then will select the male clipping connector that implements the customer selection.
<BR><BR> The jeweler will then proceed to insert the selected male connector into the universal female connector and lock it in place.  To lock the male connector in place, a pin-like rod (depicted in FIG. 1 number 20) is inserted through the aligned
holes of the universal female connector and the selected male connector, then bent to lock in place (depicted in number 5 FIGS. 6 and 7).  This will create the earrings wanted by the customer as well as the desired ear attachment method.  If the customer
changes his/her mind and decides not to buy the earrings or wants a different ear attachment method, all the jeweler has to do is unlock and remove the male connector from the universal female connector, leaving the earring ready to recipe another male
connector.  The locking mechanism described in this specification is an example of a variety of mechanisms that could be used.
<BR><BR> Other mechanisms that could be used include: a universal female connector that has the threads of a nut and the male connector with the matching threads of a bolt that can be tightened together; a universal female connector with a hole that
locks by inserting the male connector latching part through a spring-lock mechanism. <BR><BR>a name =”Drawings_Bookmark”>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR><a name =”Detail_Bookmark”>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
</a><BR><BR> A device to facilitate the setting of the ear attachment method on earrings.  The device is comprised of one universal female connector depicted in FIG. 1, and one male connector which can be selected from a set of male connectors where each one
provides a method for attaching an earring to the ear, these connectors are depicted in FIGS. 2, 3, and 4.
<BR><BR> A universal female connector depicted in FIG. 1 is attached to the back of an earring like it is depicted in FIG. 5.  This attachment is done with the idea of creating a permanent long term attachment, therefore the attachment would be done, for
example, by soldering or gluing the universal female connector to the earring.  The universal female connector depicted in FIG. 1 is of a general cubic form in which one of the sides is left hollow and the other sides form an empty cube, which is the
female connector's receptacle.  The side that is attached to the earring (numbered 2) is solid and opposite to the side (numbered 3) which is an empty side that, together with all the other perpendicular sides (numbered 4, 5, 8 and 9) to this side,
generate the female receptacle of the universal female connector.  The universal female connector has on two of its opposite sides (numbered 4 and 5), holes (numbered 6 and 7) that are horizontally aligned.  Below one of the holes and following a
perpendicular line from the top is located the closing receptacle (numbered 10).
<BR><BR> The male connector is of a general cubic form in which one of the sides is left hollow and the other sides form an empty cube (FIGS. 2, 3, 4, and 1 number 11) comprised of a top side on which the specific attachment method is implemented (FIG. 2
number 2, FIG. 3 number 2, FIG. 4 number 2, FIG. 1 number 17), two perpendicular and opposite sides (FIG. 2 numbers 8 and 9, FIG. 3 numbers 8 and 9, FIG. 4 numbers 8 and 9, FIG. 1 numbers 14 and 15), and two other perpendicular and opposite sides (FIG. 2
numbers 3 and 4, FIG. 3 numbers 3 and 4, FIG. 4 numbers 3 and 4, FIG. 1 numbers 12 and 13) having holes (FIG. 2 numbered 5 and 6, FIG. 3 numbered 5 and 6, FIG. 4 numbered 5 and 6, FIG. 1 numbered 19) that are horizontally aligned.
<BR><BR> Once a male connector is selected to implement a desired attachment method to the ear, this male connector is attached to the universal female connector already attached to the earring as depicted in FIG. 6.  FIG. 1 depicts a male (number 11)
and a female connector (number 1).  To attach the male connector (number 11) to the universal female connector (number 1), align the four sides of the male and female connectors (align number 5 with number 12, number 14 with number 8, number 4 with
number 13 and number 9 with number 15.  Insert the male connector (sides number 12, 13, 14, and 15) inside the female receptacle until the two holes on each side of the male and female connectors are aligned (hole 6 is aligned with hole 19, hole 4 is
aligned with hole on side 13).  Then insert the closing pin (numbered 20) starting on the hole (the aligned hole made of number 4 and the hole on side 13) from the opposite side where the closing receptacle (numbered 10) is located and slide said pin
across until a portion of said pin is showing outside the hole of the opposite side (align hole of number 6 and 19).  With a set of pliers or such instrument, pull the pin (number 20) to make pressure on the whole connector structure and bend said pin
downward and away from the top, placing the bended side of said pin inside of the closing receptacle (number 10).  Once the pin is inside the closing receptacle, bend the closing receptacle as embracing the pin, and securing its position (depicted in
number 5 FIGS. 6 and 7).
<BR><BR> The disclosure of the invention described herein-above represents the preferred embodiment of the invention; however, variations thereof, in the form, construction, and arrangement of the component thereof and the modified application of the
invention are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claim.
