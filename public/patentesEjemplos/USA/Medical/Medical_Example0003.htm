<CENTER><B><I> Description</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR><a name="Background_Bookmark">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
</a><BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to lightweight, portable, self-contained devices whose operation does not require external power sources to sterilize assemblages of microbiologically contaminated equipment therein.  The invention, more
specifically, relates to such a device that uses chemical methods for sterilization and disinfection of equipment, such as <B><I>medical</I></B> and surgical instruments, in field conditions where water, electrical power, and/or fuel sources may be absent,
unavailable, or of limited availability.
<BR><BR> 2.  Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR> Far-Forward Army Surgical Teams currently have no existing technology for conveniently sterilizing surgical instruments on-site.  Contaminated instruments are often transported with patients via aircraft to distant hospitals for sterilization in
large steam autoclaves, and then returned enclosed in sterile packaging to the surgical teams via aircraft for re-use.  Hospital steam autoclaves typically have 18-20 cubic foot chambers, weigh several hundred pounds, and require at a minimum permanent
steam lines, water lines, and 110V electricity for operation.
<BR><BR> Far-forward teams sometimes transport electric autoclaves into the field for carrying out sterilization.  Electric autoclaves are smaller than hospital steam autoclaves, require some installation (such as 120 and 208-240 volt electrical lines),
and consume significant amounts of water and power per sterilization cycle.  For example, a typical sterilization cycle in an electric autoclave runs for 50-60 minutes and consumes about 1.5 gallons of potable water and approximately 12 kilowatts of
power (at 236 volts).  These electrical autoclaves are in fact difficult to transport in vehicles due to their weight (&gt;100 lbs.), bulky dimensions, and reliance on generators or other power sources for operation.
<BR><BR> Currently, there are no devices available for sterilizing surgical instruments that are portable, sufficiently lightweight (3-35 lbs.) to be easily hand-carried, do not require external power sources, such as electricity, and effect the
sterilization process in 15-60 minutes.
<BR><BR> In considering the design of a conveniently portable sterilizer, a choice must first be made as to which method, conventional moist heat, radiation, or chemical, will be the best to effect sterilization.  Conventionally generated heat requires
bulky autoclaves and significant amounts of power (usually electrical) to generate steam.  Radiation requires a power supply or shielded enclosures, often both.  Chemical methods have the potential to be conveniently portable, which has led to claims of
portable disinfection, but not complete sterilization, and the chemical methods generally are not accomplished in convenient times as short as 15 minutes.
<BR><BR> Chemical sterilization involves the use of controlled chemical processes to kill microbial contaminants by either i) directly transporting biocidal chemical agents in safety carriers, or ii) transporting the appropriate chemical precursors and
chemically generating biocidal agents or sterilization conditions on-site, which often requires heavy-duty generating equipment.  In these cases, it is important to distinguish the possibility of transporting chemicals or heavy-duty equipment in vehicles
from a truly portable system.  A truly portable system can be conveniently moved, lifted, or carried by the individual user, and includes the device, equipment, and chemicals involved in effecting the sterilization process.
<BR><BR> Disinfectants such as chlorine, ethylene oxide, and fluorine-containing interhalogens are stable but highly reactive chemicals that must be transported in bulky, secure containers to ensure safety.  While these chemicals can be transported, they
are not truly portable because of their inconvenient weight and the safety precautions that must be taken to prevent accidents during shipping.
<BR><BR> Many other potent chemical disinfectants are unstable and must be generated on-site from stable chemical precursors.  The art of generating these chemical disinfectants has not been directed toward portability.  For example, methods for
generating disinfectants, such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and chlorine gas, teach synthetic and electrochemical techniques that utilize heavy and bulky power supplies, solution reservoirs, fluid pumps, vacuum lines and other gas-handling systems.  While
this equipment can possibly be transported, it is not truly portable because of its large weight and size.  Additionally, controlling this equipment requires electrical power and electrical circuitry, and transporting this equipment requires additional
steps for removal and installation before operation can commence.
<BR><BR> As indicated above, the established chemical methods currently being used to dispense or generate biocidal chemical agents or to chemically generate conditions for sterilization are not suited to lightweight portability.  There is a need for a
portable assembly for the sterilization or disinfection of microbiologically contaminated <B><I>medical</I></B> instruments, and the like, particularly one that involves using only a small amount (approximately 0.25 lb.) of safe, dry, chemical reagents; The chemical
combination must be convenient to carry and mix with water readily to generate biocidal chemical agents or conditions sufficient for effecting sterilization.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide such a portable apparatus adapted to use a chemical combination, and a number of variants thereof, that consist of mixtures of specially formulated iron-activated magnesium Mg(Fe) containing
salt, sodium chlorite (NaClO.sub.2), sodium sulfite (Na.sub.2SO.sub.3), and sodium hydrogen ascorbate (C.sub.6H.sub.7O.sub.6Na) that react in water to controllably generate sterilization conditions inside the apparatus that include the production of
biocidal chlorine dioxide, heat, and relative humidity.
<BR><BR> Chlorine dioxide (ClO.sub.2) is a potent, broad-based biocide that is effective against a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms and bacterial spores.  Chlorine dioxide is the EPA-registered disinfectant that was used to decontaminate the
<B><I>Hart</I></B> Senate Office Building and the Brentwood postal facility in Washington, D.C.  during the Anthrax attacks.  In addition, chlorine dioxide is FDA-approved for disinfecting dental equipment and wastewater stores, and is used to kill pathogens and
spoilage microorganisms that decrease the shelf-life of fresh and fresh-cut vegetables.  Industrially, ClO.sub.2 is produced from large chlorine dioxide generators and is used to treat wastewater and kill disease-carrying vectors, while protecting the
environment by reducing the production of chlorinated organic by-products to very low levels compared with chlorine.
<BR><BR><a name="Summary_Bookmark">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
</a><BR><BR> With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the present invention is the provision of a closable, portable (easy-to-carry), non-powered assembly for the sterilization of a collection of contaminated objects.  This portable, power-free
assembly accommodates controlled chemical reactions that generate in situ conditions of chemical sterilant, heat, and humidity sufficient to effect the sterilization of objects contaminated with microorganisms.
<BR><BR> The assembly includes a closable apparatus defining an outer chamber having an inner chamber for accepting microbiologically contaminated objects, an interior vessel to act as a reaction chamber, a chemical combination that upon being mixed with
water generates at least minimally sufficient conditions of chemical sterilant, heat, and humidity to effect sterilization, and valves dedicated to controllably preventing the accumulation of pressures above ambient air pressures and venting and
deactivating chemical reaction products.
<BR><BR> The preferred embodiment for this apparatus is a sterilization unit constructed from a plastic carry-case preferably weighing about 3.0-35 lbs, and of compact dimensions.  The sterilization procedure entails placing the microbiologically
contaminated equipment inside the carry case, combining the dry chemicals and water in a reactor vessel within the case, then closing and locking the case.  Built-in outlet valves prevent the accumulation of excess pressure inside the case by allowing
controlled release of heated gaseous products.  An inlet valve is used to flow air into the apparatus after the sterilization process and expel gaseous products through the outlet valves.
<BR><BR> In an alternative embodiment, the apparatus comprises a thermally insulated sterilizer unit with a vessel serving as a reaction chamber that is also called an internal boiler.  This embodiment can be constructed from an aluminum vessel similar
to a pressure cooker, preferably weighing about 17.5 lbs.  and equipped with Teflon-covered foam insulation.  The vessel is provided with a locking cover and is adapted to receive contaminated objects, and the internal boiler receives the dry chemicals
and water.  A vent pipe covered by a pressure regulator allows internal pressures to exceed atmospheric pressure to the extent needed for thermal sterilization.  The vent pipe ensures user safety by releasing enough gas to prevent the internal pressure
from becoming too high, and an accompanying dial gauge safely monitors the pressure.  This embodiment is simply opened to expel gaseous products after the sterilization process, although it could be fitted with additional outlet and inlet valves to carry
out flushing.
<BR><BR> In general, the chemical combination used to effect sterilization is an ensemble of dry chemicals that react in water to controllably generate various levels of chlorine dioxide, heat, and relative humidity.  The ensemble of dry chemicals
consists of iron-activated magnesium {Mg(Fe)}, sodium chlorite (NaClO.sub.2), sodium sulfite (Na.sub.2SO.sub.3), and sodium hydrogen ascorbate (chemical formula C.sub.6H.sub.7O.sub.6Na and designated with the symbol AH.sup.-).  Variants of the ensemble
can be formulated by removing chemicals, or by adjusting the relative concentrations of the chemicals, and these systems are still capable of inactivating contaminating microorganisms.
<BR><BR> When all of the dry chemicals are present and mixed together in water, the chemical combination generates large quantities of chlorine dioxide, heat, and humidity; we term this method "combined sterilization." Specifically, the combined
sterilization method consists of Mg(Fe), ClO.sub.2.sup.-, SO.sub.3.sup.2-, and AH.sup.- mixed in water.  In this case, the chemical combination produces copious amounts of chlorine dioxide, heat, and humidity, all of which act in concert to inactivate
contaminating microorganisms.
<BR><BR> A variant of the chemical combination can be formulated to generate large quantities of chlorine dioxide while concomitantly producing relatively low levels of heat and humidity; we term this method "chlorine dioxide sterilization." In chlorine
dioxide sterilization, the chemical combination consists of ClO.sub.2.sup.-, SO.sub.3.sup.2-, and AH.sup.- mixed in water (Mg(Fe) is excluded).
<BR><BR> Another variant of the chemical combination generates large quantities of heat and humidity without producing chlorine dioxide; we term this method "thermal sterilization." In the thermal method, the Mg(Fe)--H.sub.20 reaction acts alone to
produce substantial heat (Temperature.gtoreq.121.degree.  C.) and steam in the absence of ClO.sub.2.  In certain low temperature or high-altitude environments, the Mg(Fe)--H.sub.2O reaction can also contribute a source of heat to pre-warm or thaw the
portable chemical sterilizer or frozen water.
<BR><BR> The present invention provides for the removal of chlorine dioxide and other gases following the sterilization treatment.  For outdoor environments the apparatus is simply opened to release the remaining sterilant gas.
<BR><BR> For indoor environments, air flushing is used in conjunction with simple chemical methods to safely purge ClO.sub.2 from the sterilization apparatus.  Flowing air into the apparatus causes the expulsion of the chlorine dioxide gas through the
outlet valves of the apparatus.  The ClO.sub.2 gas passes through specially designed scrubber devices engrafted onto these outlet valves, and common reductants embedded in the scrubber such as sulfite (SO.sub.3.sup.2-) dithionite (S.sub.2O.sub.5.sup.2-),
or thiosulfate (S.sub.2O.sub.3.sup.2-) safely deactivate the chlorine dioxide gas.  The reduction of ClO.sub.2 occurs readily with these ions and these chemical reactions convert chlorine dioxide and the reductant to the environmentally safe and inert
ionic products of chloride (Cl.sup.-) and sulfate (SO.sub.4.sup.2-), respectively.
<BR><BR> Additionally, chlorine dioxide features chlorine atoms in the +4 intermediate oxidation state (the oxidation states of chlorine range from -1 to +7).  When chlorine dioxide comes in contact with a base such as sodium carbonate
(Na.sub.2CO.sub.3), the chlorine dioxide can disproportionate into likewise environmentally benign, unreactive products chloride and chlorate (ClO.sub.3.sup.-).
<BR><BR> The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims.  It will
be understood that the particular devices embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention.  The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without

<BR><BR><a name="Detail_Bookmark">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
</a><BR><BR> The present invention is directed toward a lightweight, portable apparatus in the form of a convenient carry-case or handled vessel or box for carrying out chemical reactions that convert chemical energy to forms usable for the sterilization of
microbiological contaminants without the use of external sources of power.  Within the apparatus, sterilization is achieved in situ by chemically generating conditions involving a lethal sterilant, heat, and humidity, such that exposure of the
contaminated objects to this environment sterilizes objects contaminated with harmful pathogens or infectious microorganisms.
<BR><BR> The preferred use of the portable sterilizers includes using a chemical combination that ensures the complete destruction of contaminating microorganisms in an optimal time.  Therefore, there follows below a detailed description of the chemical
combination, followed by descriptions of the embodiments of the apparatus in which the chemical combination is activated to effectuate sterilization.
<BR><BR> The chemical combination in the preferred method for sterilization is a mixture that can be decreased or increased proportionately, or that can be varied in the relative proportions of the components, depending on factors such as the size of the
container in which sterilization is to occur or to emphasize different characteristics of the chemical combination.  A representative chemical combination used for "combined sterilization" utilizes about 600 mL of water and the following approximate
proportions of dry chemicals: 3.3 mole iron-activated magnesium (85 g Mg(Fe)), 2.04 mole chlorite ion (185 g NaClO.sub.2), 1.0 mole sulfite ion (126 g Na.sub.2SO.sub.1), and 0.25 mole hydrogen ascorbate ion (50 g NaC.sub.6H.sub.7O.sub.6).  In one aspect
designated "chlorine dioxide sterilization," the Mg(Fe) can be omitted from the chemical combination (300 mL H.sub.20, 93 g NaClO.sub.2, 63 g Na.sub.2SO.sub.3, and 25 g NaC.sub.6H.sub.7O.sub.6); in another aspect designated "thermal sterilization," only
the Mg(Fe)--H.sub.20 chemical reaction (600 mL H.sub.20 and 140 g Mg/Fe) is used, and the remaining 3 components of the chemical combination are omitted.
<BR><BR> Alternative chemical combinations are also possible.  For example, the magnesium can be activated by several different transition metals, such as cobalt or nickel.  Other metallic reductants, such as calcium or sodium amalgam, can be used as
simple substitutions.
<BR><BR> The chlorine-containing oxidant (ClO.sub.2.sup.-) can derive from any one of several salts featuring different counter ions, such as lithium, sodium, potassium, or calcium cations.  The hydrogen ascorbate salt acts as an effector and can be
replaced by any appropriate effector such as ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, tartaric acid, or any of their respective ions.  Any chemical combination, such as those described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 10/988,442, incorporated herein by
reference, can be used.  In the following description, reference will be made to the chemical combination used in the preferred embodiment, but this invention is not limited to the use of only this chemical combination and this preferred embodiment. 
Other reasonable substitutions for components of the chemical combination of the preferred embodiments, which produce equivalent chemical or microbiological processes, are obvious variants of the system described herein.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIGS. 1-3, it will be seen that a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a sterilizer unit that uses a carry-case 20 that has sufficient capacity to hold at least a standard surgical autoclave tray (not shown).  The
carry-case 20 preferably defines a volume of about 46 L. Two pressure-release check valves 26 (FIG. 3) are integrated into the back 32 of the case 20 using a protective framework (not shown) so that the valves 26 do not protrude beyond the structure of
the carry-case 20, and do not interfere with stacking of the carry-cases.  A smaller carry-case 40 defining a volume of about 3.5 L is shown in FIG. 4 and features the capacity to hold a loose assemblage of contaminated instruments.  The smaller
carry-case 40 features a single 2-inch check valve 42 (FIG. 5) installed in its roof 44.  The valves 26, 42 are identical and are designed to withstand a maximum pressure of 50 psi (gauge).  The carry cases 20, 40 typically weigh about 3%-35 lbs.  and
are provided with suitcase-handles 46, such that portability is readily facilitated.
<BR><BR> The sterilization procedure for case 20 entails the simple steps of placing the microbiologically contaminated equipment (not shown) inside the case (28) on a support structure 22, adding the chemical combination (including water) in a small
interior reactor vessel 24, and closing and locking the case 20, as with latches 21.  A similar sterilization procedure is carried out for case 40.
<BR><BR> Depending on the selected chemical reaction conditions, the corresponding chemical combination controllably generates sufficient conditions of ClO.sub.2, heat, and humidity to sterilize the contaminating microorganisms within 15-120 minutes. 
Built-in pressure-release valves 26, 42 on cases 20 and 40, respectively, prevent pressure from accumulating inside the apparatus chambers (28 for both case 20 and 40, see FIGS. 3 and 5) by allowing the controlled release of heated gaseous products
formed by the chemical combination.
<BR><BR> The valves 26, 42 are initially in the closed position, but open to relieve pressure inside the chamber 28, 29 at minimal levels.  The valves 26, 42 accommodate the initial rapid pressure increase in the interior chambers 28 of carry cases 20
and 40 caused by the rapid chemical production of gaseous chemicals, heat, and steam by the activated chemical combination.  As a slight pressure builds up inside the cases from the formation of heated gases, the valves 26, 42 open slightly, and the
heated gases vent outside of the cases through the opened valves.  When the pressure has subsided sufficiently due to the escape of heated gases, the valves flap shut and return to their original closed position.  During the early parts of the reaction
with the preferred chemical combination, the pressure surges temporarily due to the chemical production of heated gaseous chemical products such as carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) and ClO.sub.2, and the valves 26, 42 open to alleviate the pressure.  As the
pressure subsides, the valves close again.
<BR><BR> After the sterilization (or disinfection) process is complete, the units 20, 40 may be flushed with air to remove the remaining ClO.sub.2 gas.  Following the air-flushing process, the user wears sterile gloves to open the case 20, 40 and remove
the sterilized (disinfected) objects, which were preferably wrapped in autoclave paper prior to the sterilization process.
<BR><BR> The sterilizer carry-case units 20, 40 are designed to control the removal of ClO.sub.2 remaining after the sterilization procedure in the following manner.  A stainless steel inlet valve 52 (for both case 20 and case 40) does not allow gases to
flow out of the case.  After the sterilization treatment, the inlet valve 52 is connected to an air pump (not shown) that inflows air into the case.  A filter 56 is placed in the inlet valve 52 to prevent the introduction of air-borne particulate matter
that might re-contaminate the sterilized objects.  Any portable hand-held or foot-operated pedal pump may be used to flow air into the apparatus.  There may be instances where it may be possible, desired, or advantageous to employ compressed air tanks or
electrically operated air pumps to carry out the flushing procedure.  Electricity or external power is in no case required to effect either the sterilization procedures or flushing of the apparatus; however, the carry-case sterilizer unit can accommodate
battery-operated air pumps for flushing in circumstances where their use may prove convenient.
<BR><BR> The incoming air is distributed within the carry-case units via 0.25 inch plastic tubing 60 disposed in a semi-circular (FIG. 3) or circular (FIG. 5) fashion around the interior perimeter of the carry-case.  Perforations 62 in the plastic tubing
60 are spaced at approximately 1-inch intervals, allowing the incoming air to circulate throughout the carry-case and mix with the remaining chlorine dioxide gas.  This influx of air slightly increases the pressure inside the apparatus chambers 28, and
the mixture of air and chlorine dioxide gas flows out of the check valves 26 and 42, integrated into the back wall 32 of the carry-case 20 (FIG. 3) and into the roof 44 of the carry case 40 (FIG. 5), respectively.  The valves 26, 42 open and close
periodically to ensure that the gases mix and that the flushing operation proceeds smoothly and safely.
<BR><BR> A gas scrubber 66 (FIG. 2 and FIG. 4) is connected to each check valve 26, 42 and absorbs the chlorine dioxide gas exiting the apparatus during any stage of the sterilization process, including flushing.  Each scrubber 66 may consist of two
layers of wire gauze (not shown) sandwiching a porous sponge material filled with a common reductant, such as sodium sulfite.  The reductant readily inactivates the ClO.sub.2 gas in the stream flow exiting the apparatus and safely limits user exposure
and environmental off-gassing of ClO.sub.2.
<BR><BR> An alternative embodiment of the present invention is an aluminum pressure vessel that is equally suited for non-powered, lightweight, portable sterilization of microbiologically contaminated objects by the in situ generation of sufficient
conditions of chlorine dioxide, heat, and humidity using the chemical methods described above.  This alternative embodiment (FIG. 6) of the sterilizer unit uses an aluminum pressure vessel 70 of about 20 liter capacity with its exterior covered in
insulating foam and wrapped in a Teflon jacket, and its lid 76 snugly fitted with a sealing ring 74 and securely locked into place using brackets 80.  An air vent 82 exhausts air from the pressurized vessel 70 and provides the first indication that heat
and gases are building pressure inside the pressurized vessel.  A vent pipe 84 covered by a pressure regulator 86 allows the controlled release of excess pressure, and an accompanying pressure gauge 88 registers the pressure inside the aluminum vessel
chamber 78.  The pressure vessel 70 typically weighs about 35 lbs or less, and is provided with handles 94 and 96, rendering the vessel 70 and lid 76 readily portable as a single, carryable unit.
<BR><BR> Inside the pressurized aluminum vessel 70, an 1800 mL volume aluminum pot 90, of approximately 7 inch diameter, covered with a perforated lid 92 is placed at the interior base of the vessel to act as the internal boiler 72 and to allow for
efficient mixing of the chemical combination.  The apparatus in this arrangement is suitable for generating conditions capable of sterilizing microbiologically contaminated objects using various chemical combinations corresponding to the sterilization
methods described above.
<BR><BR> Using the pressurized aluminum vessel 70 to carry out "combined sterilization" is accomplished by either combining all of the reagents into the single boiler 72, or judiciously dividing the reactants into separate boilers (not shown).  The heat
output of the Mg(Fe)--H.sub.2O chemical combination is intensified by the presence of chlorite, peroxodisulfate, or copper(II) ions that also act to decrease the volume of dihydrogen gas produced by scavenging specific chemical precursors.  With chlorite
as the scavenger, the chemical combination is postulated to generate chlorine dioxide as an undetectable, short-lived reactive intermediate.  The pressurized aluminum vessel 70 readily accommodates the methods of "chlorine dioxide sterilization" and
"thermal sterilization." During "thermal sterilization," temperatures inside the pressurized vessel 70 can exceed 121.degree.  C.
<BR><BR> After sterilization is complete for all of the chemical combinations, the aluminum pressure vessel 70 can be opened outdoors to release any gaseous chemical reaction products or heat to the environment, and the wrapped sterile instruments are
removed using sterile gloves.  The reaction vessel 72 is easily rinsed and cleaned, and the entire apparatus can be re-used on a new set of contaminated instruments.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art
within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
<BR><BR>Test Results
<BR><BR> A series of sterilization tests were conducted using commercially available biological indicators, live bacterial cells, or live bacterial spores to demonstrate the Portable Chemical Sterilizer using the presently available variants of hardware
configurations and chemical combinations.  Specifically, the sterilization tests used BT Sure Biological Indicator Tests for Steam Sterilizers (designated BT strips and available from Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa, USA), Difco Hy-check
disinfection control for hygiene monitoring contact slides (designated Hy-check and available from Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, Md., USA), live cells of Staphylococcus aureus (10.sup.7), Escherichia coil ATCC 11229 and 11220 (10.sup.7 each), and Listeria
monocytogenes (10.sup.6), and live spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus (10.sup.8).
<BR><BR> Cultures were suspended in Butterfield's phosphate buffer solution and placed inside the Portable Chemical Sterilizer and exposed to the conditions of biocidal chemical agent, heat, and humidity generated by the chemical combination inside the
apparatus.  S. aureus was plated on Baird-Parker Agar supplemented with Egg-Yolk tellurite and incubated at 35.degree.  C. for 48 hours, both E. coli strains and L. monocytogenes were plated on Nutrient Agar and incubated at 35.degree.  C. for 24 and 48
hours, respectively, and B. stearothermophilus spores were plated on Antibiotic Assay Medium with 1% soluble Starch (ARMS) and incubated for 24 hours at 55.degree.  C. (F E Feeherry, D T Munsey, and D B Rowley 1987 Appl Environ Microbiol 53(2), 365-370). The results of the sterilization tests are shown in Tables 1-3.
