<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a compact size generator used for automobiles and other objects.
<BR><BR><a name="Background_Bookmark">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
</a><BR><BR> A compact size generator is mounted on automobiles to be used for charging batteries and for providing electricity to electric components.  This type of generator consists of a rotor to be rotated by outer force such as an engine, and a stator
fixedly secured so as to surround the rotor.
<BR><BR><a name="Summary_Bookmark">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</a>
<BR><BR>Problems to be Solved by the Invention
<BR><BR> The above conventional generator needs to be improved in its generating efficiency because electricity is produced only by rotation of the rotor.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a generator having improved output
generating efficiency by rotating the stator in a direction opposite to that of the rotor.
<BR><BR>Means to Solve the Problems
<BR><BR> Definition of term: the wording "rotationally support" designates a condition that an object is supported by a bearing capable of rotation.
<BR><BR> The present invention will be described referring to FIGS. 1 to 7.  A generator 9 according to a first aspect of the present invention comprises a main shaft 10 to be rotated by outer force.  A cylindrical rotor 20 having a rotor coil 1 is fixed
to the periphery of the middle portion of the main shaft 10.  A front cover 40 is mounted to the periphery of the main shaft 10 at a front side of the rotor 20 through a bearing 41 for front cover 40.  The front cover 40 comprises a step portion 40a at
an outer circumference of its rear face.  A front end of a front-side external cylinder 31 is fitted and fixed to the step portion 40a.  A substantially cylindrical stator core portion 61, a rear-side external cylinder 70 and a rear cover 71 are disposed
at a rear side of the front-side external cylinder 31, in this order.  The rear cover 71 is provided with a step portion for fitting the rear-side external cylinder 70.  Long bolts 73 are inserted from the outer surface of the front cover 40 and pass
through the rear cover 71.  The long bolts 73 are tightened by respective tightening nuts 73a.  Accordingly, the front cover 40, front-side external cylinder 31, stator core portion 61 and rear cover 71 are combined together.  A tubular portion 56
projects forward from a rear-side base member 55 disposed at a rear side of the rear cover 71.  The tubular portion 56 projecting from the rear-side base member 55 is inserted in the center of the rear cover 71, and it supports the rear cover 71 capable
of rotation.  Pinion gears 43 are disposed between the main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 fixed to the main shaft 10 and the ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32 fixedly positioned with respect to the stator 60.  Each pinion <B><I>gear</I></B> 43 has a fixed pinion shaft 42.  Accordingly, rotation of the main
shaft 10 in a forward direction rotates the stator 60 in a reverse direction through the pinion gears 43 and the inner ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32.  A pair of slip collars 4a, 4b are concentrically provided to the rear cover 71 that concurrently rotates with the stator
60.  Output circuits 6a, 6b, 6c of the stator coils 5a, 5b, 5c are connected to the slip collars 4a, 4b through a rectification circuit 62.  A plurality of brushes 7a, 7b for slip collars 4a, 4b are adapted to make contact with the slip collars 4a, 4b. 
The brushes 7a, 7b are mounted to the rear-side base member 55 that is fixedly positioned with respect to a base plate 50.  Electricity is output through the brushes 7a, 7b.
<BR><BR> A generator according to a second aspect of the present invention comprises a main shaft 10 to be rotated by outer force.  A cylindrical rotor 20 having a rotor coil 1 is fixed to the outer periphery of the middle portion of the main shaft 10. 
A pair of slip rings 2a, 2b are provided to the main shaft 10 at a rear side of the rotor 20.  The slip rings 2a, 2b are connected to respective terminals 1a, 1b of conductive wires of a rotor coil 1.  Brushes 3a, 3b are connected to a rectification
circuit 62 and make sliding contact with the respective slip rings 2a, 2b.  A front cover 40 is mounted to the periphery of the main shaft 10 at a front side of the rotor 20 through a bearing 41 for front cover 40.  An inner ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32 is fixed
concentrically at a front face of the front cover 40.  A main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 is fixed to the circumference of the main shaft 10 at a front side of the bearing 41 for front cover 40.  The main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 and the inner ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32 are disposed on the same plane.  A
portion of the main shaft 10 at a front side of the main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 is rotationally supported by a front-side base member 51 that stands on a base plate 50.  Pinion gears 43 are fixed to rear ends of respective pinion shafts 42 that are rotationally
supported by the front-side base member 51.  The pinion gears 43 are adapted to engage with both the main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 and the inner ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32.  The front cover 40 comprises a step portion 40a at an outer circumference of its rear face.  A front end of a
front-side external cylinder 31 is fitted and fixed to the step portion 40a.  A substantially cylindrical stator core portion 61, a rear-side external cylinder 70 and a rear cover 71 are disposed at a rear side of the front-side external cylinder 31, in
this order.  The rear cover 71 is provided with a step portion for fitting the rear-side external cylinder 70.  Long bolts 73 are inserted from the outer surface of the front cover 40 and pass through the rear cover 71.  The long bolts 73 are tightened
by respective tightening nuts 73a.  Accordingly, the front cover 40, front-side external cylinder 31, stator core portion 61 and rear cover 71 are combined together.  A tubular portion 56 projects forward from a rear-side base member 55 disposed at a
rear side of the rear cover 71.  The tubular portion 56 projecting from the rear-side base member 55 is inserted in the center of the rear cover 71, and it supports the rear cover 71 capable of rotation.  The stator 60 is disposed at an outer
circumference of the rotor 20 through a small gap 63 between them.  A circular middle wall 65 is provided to an inner circumference of a rear-side external cylinder 70 disposed at a rear side of the stator 60.  A rectification circuit 62 is mounted to
the middle wall 65.  A rear portion of the main shaft 10 is adapted to make no contacts with the middle wall 65 and the tubular portion 56 to pass through them, and is rotationally supported by the rear-side base member 55 that stands on a base plate 50. A pair of small and large slip collars 4a, 4b are provided concentrically with the tubular portion 56 at a rear face of the rear cover 71.  The slip collars 4a, 4b are connected to respective output-side terminals 8a, 8b of the rectification circuit 62. 
The slip collars 4a, 4b are in sliding contact with brushes 7a, 7b for slip collars 4a, 4b provided to the rear-side base member 55.  Electricity generated by the stator coils 5a, 5b, 5c is output through the output circuits 6a, 6b, 6c, the rectification
circuit 62, the output-side terminals 8a, 8b of the rectification circuit 62, the slip collars 4a, 4b and the brushes 7a, 7b for slip collars 4a, 4b.
<BR><BR>Effects of the Invention
<BR><BR> In the generator having the above structure, the main shaft 10 rotated by outer force (an engine, for example) in a forward direction causes the main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 to rotate in the same forward direction.  Then, the rotation of the main <B><I>gear</I></B> 25 in the
forward direction causes the stator 60 to rotate in a reverse direction, as the rotation in the forward direction is reversed to the opposite direction by the pinion gears 43 and the inner ring <B><I>gear</I></B> 32.  Accordingly, the substantial number of rotations
of the rotor 20 with respect to the stator 60 can be increased without increasing the number of rotations of the rotor 20 itself.  This improves output from the stator 20, and provides much more increased generating efficiency than the conventional prior
art provided with a stator not rotationally fixed. <BR><BR><a name="Drawings_Bookmark">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

external cylinder 70 and a rear cover 71 are disposed at a rear side of the front-side external cylinder 31, in this order.  The rear cover 71 is provided with a step portion for fitting the rear-side external cylinder 70.  Long bolts 73 are inserted
backward from the outer surface of the front cover 40 and pass through the rear cover 71.  Each of the long bolts 73 is tightened by a corresponding tightening nut 73a.  Accordingly, the front cover 40, front-side external cylinder 31, stator core
portion 61 and rear cover 71 are combined together.  A tubular portion 56 projects forward from a rear-side base member 55 disposed at a rear side of the rear cover 71.  The tubular portion 56 projecting from the rear-side base member 55 is inserted in
the center of the rear cover 71, and it supports the rear cover 71 capable of rotation through a bearing 57 for rear cover 71.
<BR><BR> The stator 60 consists of stator coils 5a, 5b, 5c connected in a "Y" form, and is positioned in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the rotor 20 through a small gap 63 between them.  The stator 60 and the rotor 20 form the core of the
generator.
<BR><BR> A circular middle wall 65 is provided to an inner circumference of a rear-side external cylinder 70 disposed at a rear side of the stator 60.  The rectification circuit 62 is mounted to the middle wall 65.  A rear portion of the main shaft 10 is
adapted to make no contacts with the middle wall 65 and the tubular portion 56 to pass through them, and is rotationally supported by the rear-side base member 55 through a bearing 58 for rear-side base member 55.
<BR><BR> A pair of small and large slip collars 4a, 4b are provided concentrically with the tubular portion 56 at a rear face of the rear cover 71.  The slip collars 4a, 4b are connected to respective output-side terminals 8a, 8b of the rectification
circuit 62.  The slip collars 4a, 4b are in sliding contact with brushes 7a, 7b for slip collars 4a, 4b.  Electricity generated from the stator coils 5a, 5b, 5c is output through the output circuits 6a, 6b, 6c and the rectification circuit 62 having a
diode 80, and is provided to a battery 81 and electric component 82.  Both the front-side base member 51 and the rear-side base member 55 stand on the base plane 50.
<BR><BR> In the generator 9 according to the preferred embodiment, the main shaft 10 rotates by outer force provided from an engine through a pulley 11.  The rotation of the main shaft 10 causes the rotor 20 to rotate in a forward direction, and it
causes the front-side external cylinder 31, rear-side external cylinder 70, front cover 40 and rear cover 71 to rotate in a reverse direction.  Accordingly, this allows the stator 60 fixed to the front-side external cylinder 31 and the rear-side external
cylinder 70 to rotate to generate current in the stator coils 5a, 5b, 5c.  The current is then output through the brushes 7a, 7b for slip collars 4a, 4b.
<BR><BR> In this stage, the stator 60 rotates simultaneously with the rotor 20 but in the opposite direction, which substantially increases the number of rotations of the rotor 20 with respect to the stator 60.  This allows the rotating stator 60 to
produce large amount of electricity more efficiently than the conventional fixed stator.
<BR><BR> The generator 9 in the preferred embodiment allows efficient production of electricity.  This technique produces the same amount of electricity with lower rotation than the conventional prior art.  This technique also contributes in saving
energy.  In particular, the conventional generator required the rotor 20 to rotate for 1200 revolutions in a certain time in order to produce a predetermined amount of electricity, while the generator in the preferred embodiment requires only 700
revolutions.
<BR><BR> The generator according to the present invention enables each construction member to be constructed with one another, and a plurality of the constructed members to be constructed with one another to form a fully constructed generator.  The
generator in the preferred embodiment uses three pinion gears 43, but the present invention does not restrict the number of the pinion gears 43 to be used, and thus more than three pinion gears 43 can be used.  The generator according to the present
invention can be applied as a private electric generator to any fields other than the <B><I>automotive</I></B> field.
<BR><BR>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
<BR><BR> The generator according to the present invention can be used as a charging generator for exclusive use for batteries that are used for driving automobiles.  Further, the generator can be used for large-scale wind electricity generation and
domestic-use wind electricity generation.  The generator to be used for the domestic wind electricity generation can be designed to have a cylinder type wings to make the generator be compact.  Moreover, the generator according to the present invention
can be applied as an emergency electricity generator for industrial and domestic use.
