</font><BR>
<BR><CENTER><B><a name="Abstract_Bookmark">Abstract</a></B></CENTER>
<P>A process is disclosed for treating tin scraps such as tin cans and home
     scrap, to reduce the tin content of the scrap to a sufficient level to
     permit the scrap to be reprocessed in an electric furnace. In the process,
     the scrap metal is first shredded, or chopped, to a managable size which
     is then utilized as a charge to a kiln. The kiln is maintained as an
     oxidizing atmosphere. The beginning feed end temperature is not less than
     2000 degrees F. The temperature is reduced to not less than about 1650
     degrees F. to convert a part of the iron-tin alloy into its epsilon phase.
     The kiln temperature is then further reduced to not less than 1400 degrees
     F. to further convert a part of the iron-tin alloy to form the zeta phase.
     The epsilon and zeta phases additionally produce an oxide laden dust that
     is then removed. As the charge moves through the kiln, the temperature is
     further reduced to not less than 900 degrees F. to form the eta phase of
     the iron-tin alloy and additionally a metallic scale formation. An
     autogenous mill, where the feed particles are tumbled against each other,
     descales them. The metallic scale produced thereby is removed. The feed
     remaining has now had sufficient residual alloys removed to allow its use
     as a direct charge in a <B><I>steel</I></B> producing furnace.

</a><BR><BR>1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>This invention relates to <B><I>metalurgy,</I></B> and more particularly to iron and <B><I>steel</I></B> recovery from scrap metal.
<BR><BR>2.  Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR>Goods for business and personal households are often packaged in containers of tin coated metal.  Therefore, each day, as we consume or use such products, we create a major disposal and polution problem.  Furthermore, residue from <B><I>steel</I></B> making
operations such as side trims, crop ends and other tin scraps resulting from tin lines and known collectively as home scrap, create an additional disposal and polution problem.  With a constant concern over depleting our natural resources and our
environmental protection, Environmental Protection Agency approved recycling of iron-tin alloy products is to the advantage of every individual, corporation and government agency.
<BR><BR>Tin coated, iron based scrap would have an application in the <B><I>steel</I></B> making process if a low cost method could be found to reduce the residual alloys, namely tin, tin oxide, iron tin alloy, iron, ferrous oxide, ferric oxide and magnetite, and thus
leave a low residual alloy <B><I>steel</I></B> feed suitable for, primarily, electric furnaces.
<BR><BR>I have now discovered that a method related to the method I used in application Ser.  No. 06/529,290, filed Sept.  6, 1983 to recover scrap metal suitable for a charge in an electric furnace from used automobiles, will also produce scrap metal
suitable for a charge in an electric furnace from tin coated iron metals.
<BR><BR><a name="Summary_Bookmark">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<a name="Summary_Bookmark"><BR><BR>In the aforementioned application titled "Method For Preparing A Low Residual Alloy <B><I>Steel</I></B> Charge From Scrap Metal", Ser.  No. 06/529,290, I disclosed a process wherein vehicle scrap (minus only the gas tank for safety reasons) is first shredded
to a manageable size and thereafter fed into a rotary kiln.  The kiln feed end is maintained at about 1700 degrees F. and an oxidizing atmosphere is provided.  At this temperature, and in an oxidizing atmosphere, the zinc is fumed to zinc oxide dust. 
Likewise, copper is also oxidized to cuprite--a red powder form.  The oxide laden dust produced may be recovered by standard flotation techniques.
<BR><BR>As the feed continues through the kiln, the atmosphere is changed to reducing and the temperature adjusted to not less than about 1900 degrees F. to cause metallic scale to form on the feed particles.  The scale is primarily copper, nickel,
chromium, lead, zinc and melted aluminum.
<BR><BR>As the feed discharges, it proceeds directly, without cooling, to a mill, preferably an autogenous mill, where lifters lift, drop and tumble the particles against each other to descale them.  The metallic scale is brittle and this milling process
step effectively cleanses the ferrous metal of surface alloy scale.  The atmosphere must be neutral to prevent reoxidizing of the now reduced metals.  The autogenous mill is cooled by, preferably refrigerated, water.  The mill may be immersed in a water
trough to effect this cooling, or water may be sprayed on the mill, or both.
<BR><BR>The metallic scale dust formed may be removed by screening and recovered by flotation or other conventional means.  The feed is now separated, preferably magnetically, to remove aluminum, glass and tailings.  The material remaining is
sufficiently reduced in residual alloy content to permit its use as a charge for electric <B><I>steel</I></B> making furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces or open hearth furnaces.
<BR><BR>In this continuation-in-part application, I continue to generally utilize the aforementioned method.  However, I have now discovered that a related method, by changing the composition of the scrap material or kiln feed and also changing the kiln
temperatures, can be used for treating a tin coated metal.  For example, when I alter the kiln feed to be that of tin, such as "tin" cans and "home scrap", containing about 0.75% to 1.1% tin, I can also recover a low residual alloy suitable for a <B><I>steel</I></B>
charge by using a modification of the previously discussed method.
<BR><BR>In this invention, tin scrap is first shredded to a manageable size and thereafter fed into a rotary kiln as in the previous application.  The kiln feed end temperature is, however, about 2000 degrees F. and is maintained at not less than about
1650 degrees F. (preferably 1652 degrees F.) with an oxidizing atmosphere to convert at least part of the iron-tin alloy into its epsilon phase (Fe.sub.2 Sn) and additionally producing a dust of tin and tin oxide.
<BR><BR>In this invention, kiln temperatures are reduced by adding air, preferably through shell fans, and adjusting air-fuel ratio of the shell burners.
<BR><BR>As the feed continues through the kiln, the kiln temperature is further reduced to not less than about 1400 degrees F. (preferably 1452 degrees F.) with a continuing oxidizing atmosphere (rather than a reducing atmosphere as in the previous
application) to further convert part of the iron-tin alloy into its zeta phase (FeSn) and producing additional oxide laden dust of tin and tin oxide.
<BR><BR>As in the previous application, the oxide laden dust produced may also be removed in conventional dust collectors and may be recovered by standard flotation techniques.
<BR><BR>As the feed continues through the kiln, the kiln temperature is further reduced to not less than 900 degrees F. (preferably 925 degrees F.) with a continuing oxidizing atmosphere (rather than reducing as in the prior application) to still further
convert part of the iron-tin alloy into its eta phase (FeSn.sub.2) and additionally producing a metallic scale formation of tin, tin oxide, iron tin alloy, iron, ferrous oxide, ferric oxide and magnetite.
<BR><BR>In both applications, as the feed discharges, it proceeds directly, without cooling, to a mill, preferably an autogenous mill, where lifters lift, drop and tumble the particles against each other to descale them.  The metallic scale is brittle
and this milling process step effectively cleanses the ferrous metal of surface alloy scale.  The atmosphere, in this application, must remain oxidizing so as to correspond with the oxidizing atmosphere of the kiln.  The autogenous mill is cooled by,
preferably refrigerated, water.  The mill may be immersed in a water trough to effect this cooling, or water may be sprayed on the mill, or both.
<BR><BR>The metallic scale dust formed is removed by screening and recovered by flotation or other conventional means.  The recovered metals in this application are tin, tin oxide, iron tin alloy, iron, ferrous oxide, ferric oxide and magnetite.  In this
application, there is no need for magnetic separation as only the residual alloy remains after the metallic scale recovery.  The material remaining is sufficiently reduced in residual alloy content, that is, 96% to 98% tin removable, to permit its use as
a charge for electric <B><I>steel</I></B> making furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces and open hearth furnaces.
<BR><BR>Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a suitable <B><I>steel</I></B> charge of low residual alloy from tin-coated metals.
<BR><BR>It is another object of this invention to provide a process for recycling tin cans and home scrap from <B><I>steel</I></B> plant operations with greater cost effectiveness than is now possible by other methods.
<BR><BR>It is another object of this invention to effect the aforementioned cost savings by a process which is faster than prior art processes by providing a continuous production line for producing a furnace charge.
<BR><BR>It is yet another object of this invention to provide an iron-tin alloy charge for electric furnaces which, by virtue of its lower alloy, e.g. non-ferrous component, requires less retention in the electric furnace and less use of lime.
<BR><BR>It is also an object of this invention to provide a tin coated metal process which is ecologically advantageous because the entire scrap is processed.
<BR><BR>It is still another object of this invention to provide a process which is less expensive by providing a method whereby only an oxidizing kiln operation is required.
<BR><BR>It is yet another object of this invention to solve a fume disposal problem and Environmental Protection Agency requirement in that the process can also remove the tin from home scrap found in <B><I>steel</I></B> making furnaces, and this can be removed prior
to scrap charge to the basic oxygen furnace or open hearth furnace.  This would provide a tin free fume from the furnace, and enable the fume to be pelletized, indurated for a charge to the blast furnace.  This cannot be done at the present time since
the fume contains zinc, tin and lead; when charged to the blast furnace in the form of pellets would attack the refractory lining.  This process thus solves a fume disposal problem and solves an Environmental Protection Agency requirement in that the
zinc, tin and lead rich fume should not be dumped, but recycled to the blast furnace.
<BR><BR>These and other objects will be more readily ascertainable to one skilled in the art from a consideration of the following FIGURE, descriptions and exemplary embodiments. <BR><BR><a name="Drawings_Bookmark">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
</a><BR><BR>The drawing illustrates a flow chart of the process of this invention. <BR><BR><a name="Detail_Bookmark">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)
</a><BR><BR>Referring now to the Drawing, tin coated metal 10, containing 0.75% to 1.10% tin, is prepared as feed as it passes through shredder 12.  Shredder 12 may be of the conventional grinding mechanism type, and grinds scrap 10 to a managable average
size, preferably about 4.times.0.  Scrap 10 is then moved as feed to rotary kiln 14 at feed end 16.  This conveyance may be by, for example, a conventional pan feeder which is represented at 15.
<BR><BR>Rotary kiln 14, which may be a standard kiln such as a Lurgi type, has a beginning temperature at the feed end of about 2000 degrees F. and the atmosphere is kept as an oxidizing atmosphere throughout the process.  The temperature is then reduced
by air fans to not less than about 1650 degrees F. (preferably 1652 degrees F.) to convert at least part of the iron-tin alloy 10 into its epsilon phase and additionally producing an oxide laden dust of tin and tin oxide as indicated at 18.
<BR><BR>Kiln 14's temperature is further reduced by air fans to not less than about 1400 degrees F., preferably 1452 degrees F., to further convert part of tin coated metal 10 into its zeta phase, additionally producing an oxide laden dust of tin and tin
oxide also indicated at 18.
<BR><BR>Tin and tin oxide at 18 may be collected at dust collector 20 and removed thereafter by flotation cells as indicated at 22, or other conventional means to separate and recover the tin and tin oxide.  Removal of powder 18 from kiln 14 is aided by
the use of an induced draft fan 24.
<BR><BR>As feed 10 moves along kiln 14, the temperature is further reduced by air fans to not less than 900 degrees F., preferably 925 degrees F., to further convert part of iron-tin alloy 10 into its eta phase and, additionally producing a metallic
scale formation.
<BR><BR>As feed 10 leaves rotary kiln 14 at its discharge end 17, it proceeds to autogenous mill 26.  The feed may be transported from kiln 14 to mill 26 by a bifurcated chute, if desired, to remove samples for testing.  Autogenous mill 26 functions to
cause scrap 10 to tumble and fall against itself for the purpose of removing the now formed brittle coatings of the eta phase of iron-tin scrap feed 10.
<BR><BR>Feed 10 proceeds to mill 26 without intermittent cooling and thus mill 26 would be heated by feed 10.  Initial mill temperature may be as high, therefore, as 925 degrees F. Spray cooling by water 27, or an immersion bath of mill 26, shown at 29,
can be utilized to cool mill 26 to about 75 degrees F.
<BR><BR>Autogenous mill 26 is preferably fitted with lifters as is conventional in this art.  Lifters are utilized to pick up feed 10, dropping it on itself to achieve the cleaning of the metal alloys from the remaining scrap which is now largely iron in
composition.  Tumbling may also be employed to achieve this separation from feed 10.
<BR><BR>Following treatment in autogenous mill 26, feed 10 progresses through screen 28 at preferably about 20 mesh.  Tin oxide, tin, iron tin alloy, iron, ferrous oxide, ferric oxide and magnetite, as material of less than 20 mesh, may be separated by
flotation cells as indicated at 30.  Material greater than 20 mesh is now sufficiently reduced to alloy content of tin from about 0.75% to about 0.03% tin and the 1.1% tin plate is reduced to about 0.022% tin, each of which is suitably low for use as a
direct charge for a <B><I>steel</I></B> making furnace 32.
<BR><BR>In practicing the process of this invention, it should be noted that the following parameters are critical.  The epsilon phase is stable from 1400 degrees F. to 1652 degrees F. The zeta phase is stable at all temperatures below 1472 degrees F.
The eta phase is stable below 925 degrees F. Therefore, temperatures associated with these phases must be maintained as close as possible to get the maximum conversion.
<BR><BR>It is also critical to maintain an oxidizing atmosphere within the kiln and autogenous mill to achieve this phase change.
<BR><BR>While not critical, a feed size of 4.times.0 performs best, because of a combination of handling considerations and the need to bring the feed up to near kiln temperatures.  Also, a small feed size increases the surface area and therefore reduces
retention time and thereafter permits use of a smaller size kiln.
<BR><BR>The method of this invention has many advantages.  Chiefly among these is that waste material can be recycled into a low residual alloy <B><I>steel</I></B> feed for, primarily, electric furnaces.
<BR><BR>Secondly, the low residual alloy <B><I>steel</I></B> feed provides a tin free fume from the furnace, enabling the fume to be pelletized and indurated, and thus recycled into the blast furnace.
<BR><BR>Having now described and illustrated my invention, it is not intended that such description be limiting, but rather that the invention be limited only by a reasonable interpretation of the appended claims.
